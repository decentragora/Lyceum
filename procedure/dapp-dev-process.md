## User Interfaces (UI)
The design and build for a dapp should always be user-friendlyâ€” keep in mind the ergonomics, navigation and accessbility of the dapp. 

A key; always keep the flow very straightforward & easy to understand for anyone. 

Crypto onboarding should be effortless and indistinguishable from traditional applications found across the web. 

### Focus Areas

- Wallet connections
- Transaction prompts 
- Buttons and menus
- Proper spacing and padding
